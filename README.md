# Redis based Weather Web-App
This is an upgraded weather web-app, which demonstrates the use of few production level tech stack. <br>
This web-app uses Redis and Docker two of the most essential tech used for production.
***
Redis is an in-memory, NoSQL data structure. All data in redis is stored in a key-value pair. This enables caching with which we can access recently searched items faster. Hence faster then directly retrieving data from a database, thus providing a finer user experience.

Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers. Hence combining application source code with the operating system (OS), libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

## Hence this project is created to demonstrate these production level tech-stack.

To use this project download or clone it to your device. Make sure to type npm install in your terminal.
If familiar with docker you can use docker-compose up to run the web-app.
